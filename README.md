GitHub Repository: Adding Context to Questions for GPT-3 API via GitHub Repositories

## What is this?

This is a Go program that adds context to questions for the GPT-3 API via GitHub repositories. 

## How does it work?

1. The program first clones the specified GitHub repository into a temporary directory.
2. It then reads all the Go files in that directory and combines them into a single string.
3. Next, it prompts the user to enter a question about the code.
4. The program then sends the question along with the code to the GPT-3 API using the [go-gpt3](https://github.com/PullRequestInc/go-gpt3) package.
5. The API will then generate a response to the question along with additional context extracted from the provided code.
6. The program outputs the generated response.

## How do I use it?

To use this program, you will need to have a GPT-3 API key from OpenAI. Once you have your key, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Inside the cloned directory, run `go mod download` to download the required dependencies.
3. Run `go build addContext.go` to build the program.
4. Run the program with the following flags:

  - `-u` or `--url`: The GitHub repository URL to clone.
  - `-q` or `--question`: The question to ask about the code.
  - `-k` or `--key`: Your OpenAI API key.
   Example usage:

   ```bash
   $ ./addContext -u https://github.com/exampleUser/exampleRepo -q "What is the purpose of this function?" -k YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY
   ```
